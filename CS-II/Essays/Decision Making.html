    <h2>Overconfidence</h2>      
    <p class="apa7">&emsp; Most people have a tendency to be, “more confident in their own abilities than is objectively reasonable” which could lead to underestimation (Ethics Unwrapped 2018). For our instance, this bias could affect our decision making when planning out the project schedule. We might be overconfident and underestimate how long it would take to complete a task, which could lead to procrastination. To minimize this decision bias, we would have to work on planning the gantt chart with reasonable time stamps and task divisions. Not only planning is required, but we would also have to strictly follow the schedule we created, so that we do not fall behind the schedule to complete the project by the due date.
      <br><br></p>


    <h2>Complexity</h2>
    <p class="apa7">&emsp; Since our project is not a simple task but rather a large group project, it would be easy for us to be overwhelmed and experience some amounts of stress. This could lead to complexity bias, in which our decision qualities are based on stress levels. According to the stress and pressure curve by Yerkes Dodson, the best decision quality takes place when people are experiencing optimal amounts of stress, not when people are experiencing no/low stress. Therefore to maximize the quality of our decision making, we would have to load ourselves with adequate amounts of work and stress, but also be careful not to overwork ourselves.
      <br><br></p>

    <h2>Completeness</h2>
    <p class="apa7">&emsp; The people who have chosen the model scheduler for the ISP will be separated into different teams and each will be making their own version of the scheduler. At the end, one will be chosen to be used prior to the arena scheduling. During this selection process, because people “often estimate how much [they] should consume of a product based on aspects of its physical shape”, we would have to be aware of the completeness bias, which is a bias favoring works that appear to be complete/organized. (Sevilla 2014). The way to overcome this bias would be to carefully look at all the features and check if they are functioning as they are intended to do, rather than deciding by its outer appearance. This would be significant because the features might seem working, but not actually due to wrong logic. Being aware of this bias would help us to eliminate errors.
      <br><br></p>

    <h2>Confirmation </h2>
    <p class="apa7">&emsp; Confirmation bias comes from the “tendency to process information by looking for, or interpreting, information that is consistent with one’s existing beliefs” (Casad 2022). This might influence our process during the project because it can happen all the time when it comes to decision making. People are less likely to listen to other people with different opinions of doing things because of this bias. And to overcome such things, we would have to work on listening and respecting other team members’ ideas and practice concluding with the best option.
      <br><br></p>

    <h2>Order</h2>
    <p class="apa7">&emsp; Order bias explains the tendency of people selecting/focusing the first or the last item in a list. This bias could play a role in our decision making process on how we spend time on each part of the project. To overcome this bias, we would have to make sure that we do not spend too much time on the first part of the project, and make sure that we invest time evenly on every part. A well planned gantt chart would also be helpful to overcome this bias.
