    <p class="apa7">&emsp; A secure HTTPS connection provides security and privacy by allowing encryption of the data transmitted between the server and the user that no one knows how to break. However the growth of HTTPS usage has blinded corporations, schools, and other organizations and made them unable to track their employees or students’ internet usage. They responded by deploying a new technology known as “HTTPS Proxy Appliances”, which are devices that are placed between the connection of the user and the server which makes it possible to intercept data. This is an example of MITM (Man In The Middle), which holds the risk of a third party intercepting all the data being transmitted between the server and the user that could be used maliciously. To prevent these SSL interceptions, a fingerprint is issued using a hash. A hash is a “complex mathematical algorithm” that turns data into a fixed-size value. Fingerprints are examples of hash values, which are then handled by a Certificate Authority (CA) to make it validated and to bind them to cryptographic keys through the issuance of electronic documents known as digital certificates. A good hash generates a very different hash value even when a small change was made in the original string. This makes SSL interception to be easily detected, since a great part of the hash value would be different because it is hard to copy the certificate information perfectly. These could be detected by false-positive and false-negative states. False-positive state is when “the IDS identifies an activity as an attack but the activity is acceptable behavior”, while false-negative state means when the activity is an actual attack.<br><br>
