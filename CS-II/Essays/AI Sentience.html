      <h5>Artificial Intelligence</h5>
      <p class="apa7"><br>
	&emsp;The rise of this new technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has benefited our daily lives as human beings starting from replacing a chess opponent, to nowadays replacing a car driver. They suggest new videos to watch on video platforms, and even where to go when it comes to navigating. But these types of AIs were just simply “extracting statistical patterns from large data sets” rather than making decisions through how the word “intelligence” suggests (Metz 2022).<br><br>
      </p>
      <h5>Sentient AIs</h5>
      <p class="apa7"><br>
	&emsp;A sentient AI is a developing technology, which is a thinking and learning artificial intelligence. They are capable of tasks that only humans could do that required thinking. For example, GPT-3, an Ai developed by OpenAI can “write screenplays, compose marketing emails and develop video games” (Roose 2022). Additionally, in August 2022, an AI generated Artwork titled “Théâtre D’opéra Spatial” won first prize competing against human artists at a Colorado State Fair and acknowledged the potential of sentient AIs.<br><br>
      </p>
      
      <h5>Sentient AI will lead to...</h5>
      <p class="apa7"><br>
	&emsp;The growth and use of sentient AIs would not lead to the perfect and ideal utopia for humans, but it would effectively bring our human beings to a step closer. As mentioned above, sentient AIs have a great potential that are no longer limited to data sets anymore. Therefore, it is likely that sentient AIs will promote human development and make our world a better place.<br><br><br><br>
