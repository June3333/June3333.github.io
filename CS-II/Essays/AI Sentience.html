	&emsp; The rise of this new technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has benefited our lives as human beings starting from replacing a chess opponent, to nowadays replacing a car driver. They suggest new videos to watch on video platforms, and even where to go when it comes to navigating. These AIs also started to develop sentience, which means that they are working towards to feel emotion, just like humans. These Sentient AIs could be beneficial, but humans could be relying too much on these technologies, which could lead to the downfall of humans. <br> &emsp; Sentient AIs are just like humans. They can think, express emotion, perceive and feel, and for the most important part, learn. Even though these AIs aren't perfect yet, the replacement of humans by these AIs have already started, as mentioned in the beginning. They are already good enough to replace humans in certain criterias to perform tasks. But what if it comes to replacing human’s own unique things such as emotions? Human to human interaction would be no longer needed as AIs can perfectly replace humans and they would be a better “person” to talk to. Also as sentient AIs could learn and express their own thoughts, people could be brainwashed and puppetized just how some people get gaslighted by other people since those AIs will grow as more intelligent beings than us humans. <br> &emsp; It may sound irrational when people talk about AI domination of humans, but things are changing rapidly. People should really start considering these topics, as it's no longer a topic to just laugh it off.<br><br><br></p>
