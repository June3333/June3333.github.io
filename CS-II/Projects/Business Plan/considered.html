	I agreed with the point that Skyward needs an alternative because it has a terrible interface and a terrible app. I recently noticed that the Skyward app doesn’t provide a convenient way to view the grades for each assignment, so I considered this proposal. However, I ultimately decided to reject this idea since Skyward does the job on what it is supposed to do. Also thinking about security reasons and additional features like arena scheduling, I thought it would be challenging to make a new system from scratch.<br><br>

	This is a good proposal because I felt like the current Allen high school website for clubs is not updated very often and hard to look through them. I liked the idea of centralizing school clubs in a single place, and allowing to make or manage them in the same website. However, I am rejecting this proposal because he didn’t have his link for the proposal working, so I couldn’t access the details of his plan. Consideration was made based on the description in the google sheet.<br><br>

	I considered this proposal because I found it interesting that they were trying to make a 2D fighting game similar to sonic and fall guys and flappy birds. Even though I would love to try making a game, I decided to reject this one because I couldn’t get an idea of how the game was going to work because their proposal wasn’t detailed enough.<br><br>

	I considered this proposal because I thought it would benefit both the students and the teachers from attendance taking. It would also help the students to bring and have their IDs around their neck all the time. However, I rejected this plan because I’ve seen schools that are already doing this and because the revenue system was not clear.<br><br>

	I thought this idea was brilliant because last year's bus schedule was a complete mess. One day I had to wait for more than 30 minutes without knowing when the bus would come so I thought this plan would solve these kinds of problems as well as providing other benefits. However, I rejected this plan because most of the morning and drop off buses are mostly on time. Also most of the schools don’t have shuttles to other places like the Steam center during school hours, so I thought it wouldn’t be appealing to many schools/districts.<br><br>

I liked this idea because I’ve always wanted to try cooking something by myself, but I didn’t know where to start because I didn’t know what to make with the ingredients I have. Although having this app would be nice, I think there are many apps and websites that are similar to this so I decided to reject this proposal.<br><br>

	I liked this idea because I thought it was a really useful feature. However, similar websites and programs like this are now easily accessible on the internet so I thought it would be difficult to compete with all those websites and programs. Additionally, I couldn’t see the detailed plan on their plan page so I decided to reject this idea.<br><br>

	I considered this idea because it seemed to be a well planned project. However, the unique features of their website that they mentioned were the things that a website called Indeed already has. I thought it would be nearly impossible to compete with Indeed since it is a well known job finding website.<br><br>

	This proposal was interesting to me because it was about drummers and tempo maintenance. However I thought the idea would be difficult to be implemented because it involved a hardware requirement, which is basically an electric drum. Additionally, I thought there wasn’t anything unique to it because the electric drum I own already has a metronome feature as well as a tempo trainer similar to the one in this proposal, so I decided to reject this idea.<br><br>

	I decided to accept this plan because I thought this was a great idea to reduce the time for the students to get lunch from the cafe. Their revenue streams are well planned out, and I thought it would be beneficial to everybody to have this system.<br><br>
