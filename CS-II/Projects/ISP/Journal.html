	- Technical challenges<br>
	&emsp; One technical challenge this week was figuring out how to make the collapsible menu. I studied and tried many ways of doing it, but I couldn’t figure out a single method that works. Instead, I talked to our project manager about this, and I was told to just make the formatting for the mobile user to look better since the whole point of the collapsible menu was for small screen users. Since I already knew how to change the css file depending on screen size from trying the collapsible menu, it was a light task for me to change the formatting for the navigation bar. But another challenge was knowing what to edit for other elements as well because our css files were really messy and I had to look over all the css files to find the element I wanted to change.<br><br>
	- Scheduling challenges<br>
	&emsp; Since we only had one class this week because of the 4 day weekend, and most communication was done through discord, there weren't any scheduling challenges that we faced. Also we used the one class we had as a work day, so we could have meaningful in person interactions. <br><br>
	- Interpersonal challenges<br>
	&emsp; Because of the short week, we didn’t have any interpersonal challenges this week. <br><br>

	- Technical challenges<br>
	&emsp; I faced several technical challenges this week. Specifically, I was trying to figure out how to create a collapsible navigation bar for small screens, but I wasn't able to find a solution despite my best efforts. However, I plan to continue studying and working on this task. At the very least, I'll have the separate html file for the navigation bar working. <br><br>
	- Scheduling challenges<br>
	&emsp; One personal scheduling challenge was about making out the time to work on this. My AP Stats class had quizzes every day this week, and I had AP Chem AP US History and AP Physics 1 test all in one day. I was overloaded with other classes work, and I had no personal time this week so it was really stressful. <br><br>
	- Interpersonal challenges<br>
	&emsp; People started spamming useless draft issues to our github without description because of the new canvas assignment. Although it was a little annoying, our use of github issues were more active and useful and organized. <br><br>

	- Technical challenges<br>
	&emsp; One technical challenge we had was about email authentication. I had confusions about how the thing worked, but after listening to Mr. Ben's explanation during class, it made perfect sense. Another challenge I had was turning our navigation bar to a smaller collapsible menu when the screen gets smaller. I’m currently working on this, and will try to figure it out during the weekend if I have time.<br><br>
	- Scheduling challenges<br>
	&emsp; Our communication got a lot better after Mr. Ben talked about it, so our group could discuss a lot about our project. Also thanks to our project manager, everyone in our group got tasks through discord, and I liked it because people now have things to work on. However the task assignment seemed pretty random so I was a bit concerned about the outcomes. <br><br>
	- Interpersonal challenges<br>
	&emsp; One interpersonal challenge came in when assigning people tasks. Some people seemed to be unpleasant about getting tasks that weren't part of their role. This could be solved by more communication among our team members so we can figure out who works on what based on their preferences. <br><br>

	- Technical challenges<br>
	&emsp; We are still working on email authentication and rest apis. Other than that, the problem I had last week was solved by asking my teacher. He told me to just make the seat availability feature just for the primary schedule, and to not count the backup schedule. The solution was pretty simple; I don’t know why I couldn’t figure it out on my own.<br><br>
	- Scheduling challenges<br>
	&emsp; Since we had this week off because of bad weather, we couldn’t communicate much and had very little progress. But one of our teammates worked really hard during the off days, and he made great progress for the backend.<br><br>
	- Interpersonal challenges<br>
	&emsp; There weren’t any interpersonal challenges this week since we had so many days off, and because we had very little communication among our team. But I can say that the relationship of the two teammates who seemed to dislike each other improved.<br><br>

	- Technical challenges<br>
	&emsp; We still weren’t able figure out how we are going to make the login feature for seat availability without acquiring their student id or their school email. Also for last year, I remember that they wanted us to create several schedules as a backup in case we couldn’t schedule the class at the time we wanted. Because of this, I thought the seating availability feature would be unnecessary and confusing since the students will be creating multiple backup schedules. I would have to talk to my teammates and to my teacher to discuss about this.<br><br>
	- Scheduling challenges<br>
	&emsp; One scheduling challenge I had personally was about participating. From Tuesday through Friday, I had quizzes and tests every day which some of them were really content heavy. I also have upcoming tests on Monday and Tuesday, so I really didn’t have time to do anything related to this ISP this week. Also the class time was used up by the SQL lesson/quiz, so I didn’t have time even during class to work and communicate with our team members. There’s really nothing I can do about this issue, but I will work on my best to participate in this project whenever I’m not busy.<br><br>
	- Interpersonal challenges<br>
	&emsp; One interpersonal challenge was about communication. Many of our backend team members seemed lost including me. Someone in our group even asked for a task to do, but the answer that came back wasn’t clear. Also we have our chat channel in our discord server separate for front and back ends, but people just typed everything in one general channel so I had a hard time reading through all those unnecessary messages as a back end. We can solve this problem by using the todo list more actively and assigning people tasks to do.<br><br>

      <p class="apa7">

	- Technical challenges<br>
	&emsp; One technical challenge we had was about creating the feature that allows people to see how much seats are left. We were not allowed to take in any personal information like the student ID and school email, so we had to figure out a way to create some sort of a key that can be given to the user so that they can not take up more than one space in a class. We would have to communicate and come up with an idea to solve this issue.<br><br>
	- Scheduling challenges<br>
	&emsp; One scheduling challenge we had was about a meeting. We had a discord meeting on Thursday at 7 pm, but I could not join because I had another schedule going on. We could improve this issue by logging important discussions and decisions and letting people know that were not able to join.<br><br>
	- Interpersonal challenges<br>
	&emsp; There weren’t any interpersonal challenges this week, but some of our team members said that they were going to be splitting off of our project to create another scheduling app for next year. I hope that their project goes well.<br><br>

	- Technical challenges<br>
	&emsp; Technical challenges we had this week were about github. We were not able to lock the main branch and give access to only those who should. Because of this, many people pushed non-final stuff to the main branch instead of the working branch which made our team confused. We are trying to figure out a way to lock the main branch.<br><br>
	- Scheduling challenges<br>
	&emsp; We had a couple people who didn’t join the discord server for our ISP. Because of this, we had a delay in selecting the role and communicating for how things will plan out. However everyone eventually joined except for the one person who got grounded, so this issue is now solved. Another challenge was having a meeting with people who were not in our class period. We can overcome this issue by having some sort of a virtual meeting.<br><br>
	- Interpersonal challenges<br>
	&emsp; This week, we had minor conflicts with creating issues on github. We had to create 3 issues per person as a canvas assignment, but the problem was that we had like 20 people working on the same project. This made people to create meaningless/simple tasks as an issue and this enraged a couple people in our group. We solved this issue by closing most of the issues that didn’t have a description. <br><br>

	- (Software) Development Engineer<br>
	&emsp; Software Development Engineers are responsible for programming and designing the software. They would have to make sure that all features work as intended, and all the logic behind those features are valid and reasonable. This role could be challenging when creating a complex function that would have to handle many different cases. I would be suitable for this role because I have confidence in programming. <br><br>
	
	- QA Engineer<br>	
	&emsp; A QA Engineer ensures that the program functions properly without any errors and fixes bugs if any are found. Requires attention to all the details of the project and problem solving skills. This role could be challenging since they would have to try every possible way of breaking the logic of the code. I would be suitable for this role because I think I have the ability to think through most of the possible cases that could cause an error.<br><br>
	
	- Project Manager<br>
	&emsp; A project manager takes responsibility for leading the project. They will have to plan the project, set deadlines, and communicate with the team members to ensure that the project is on progress. This role could be challenging since they would be monitoring the whole project. I would not be suitable for this role because I am not good at taking care of multiple things at once. <br><br>
	
	- Product Manager<br>
	&emsp; A product manager is responsible for identifying the needs of the users and coming up with ideas and features to fulfill them. This role could be challenging because it requires knowledge of their target customers/users, and because they would have to communicate with them for possible feedback. It would be difficult to have this role in our project because the expectations of our project is already set by the school and there’s nothing much to do. <br><br>
	
	- Release Engineer<br>
	&emsp; A release Engineer manages, documents, and enhances the team's software products and implementation. They are responsible for software builds and releases. They work closely with QA Engineers to ensure that the program meets the standards. I would not be suitable for this role because I personally find it difficult to manage and document files. <br><br>
