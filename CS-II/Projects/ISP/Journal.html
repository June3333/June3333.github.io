      <p class="apa7">
	&emsp; This SA achieved my goal as intended by fixing the problem of meme videos blocking the actual content. Even though I wanted to just remove all the meme videos, I made the visibility optional by adding a function to the existing button since some of our teammates seemed willing to keep them. Also I planned to fix the drag and drop not working in FireFox, but since I didn’t have much time this week, I couldn’t finish it.<br><br>
	
	- Scheduling challenges<br>
	&emsp; It was hard for me to make time to work on the model scheduler this week because of illness and AP exams. Also Mr. Ben gave us an additional assignment so I didn’t even have class time to work on it. <br><br>
	
	- Interpersonal challenges<br>
	&emsp; Our model scheduler ended up with useless additional features like the meme videos and a tutorial page because of the required significant achievement assigned every week. I think we would have to work on communicating what is needed and what is not.<br><br>

      <p class="apa7">
	&emsp;This SA achieved my goal by correcting the time schedule. Although I forgot to fix the times in the variables in js files, my teammates caught my mistake and fixed it for me. Also one of my teammates changed the class time to the incorrect time again, so I had to revert the commit and let them know that the schedule is changing next year by the comments in their commit and issue. This achievement is significant because nobody in our team seemed to know that the school is changing up the bell schedule, which could’ve led to providing incorrect information to our users.<br><br>
	
	- Technical challenges<br>
	&emsp; One technical challenge was fixing the drag and drop when it is used in FireFox. I had no idea how to fix it and had to research. I would have to keep researching to figure out the solution.<br><br>
	
	- Interpersonal challenges<br>
	&emsp; One person in my team reverted my commit thinking that it was a mistake. This wouldn’t have happened if they at least tried to skim through the commits and look at why these changes were made. I clearly stated and linked the issue number to my issue and provided the information of why this change is being made.<br><br>

	&emsp; One technical challenge this week was bug fixing. After the release of our project, there were lots of feedback from the student users, and from Mr. Ben. Although those feedbacks were bugs that we were aware of, we had a hard time fixing those bugs because the S1 S2 stuff was confusing all of our team members. We would have to work on this even though the project was released, so it could be improved in the future.<br><br>

	&emsp; One technical challenge this week was trying to center the number in the circle for the nav bar. After changing the navbar from the text 1 2 3 to circled 1 2 3, one of my team members said to try centering the numbers, but I couldn’t figure out how to do it. However, no one in our team seemed to know how to fix it anyways, so we just decided to leave it as it is as the alignment wasn’t noticeably off.<br><br>

	&emsp; One team member seemed to just copy and paste the whole code from the internet to make the feature he was assigned.

I had to look for where the weird styling was coming from, which made me consume time.<br><br>

	&emsp; One technical challenge this week was trying to make the mobile formatting look better. The CSS file we had was really messy, so I had a hard time figuring out what to change. Also whenever I re-run the program after editing the file, I had to log in again to the model scheduler every time, so it took a lot of time checking and editing the files. To solve this issue, I would try using a different shell that's made for easier css and html designing, or ask to remove the login thing when I work on it. <br><br>

	&emsp; One technical challenge this week was figuring out how to make the collapsible menu. I studied and tried many ways of doing it, but I couldn’t figure out a single method that works. Instead, I talked to our project manager about this, and I was told to just make the formatting for the mobile user to look better since the whole point of the collapsible menu was for small screen users. Since I already knew how to change the css file depending on screen size from trying the collapsible menu, it was a light task for me to change the formatting for the navigation bar. But another challenge was knowing what to edit for other elements as well because our css files were really messy and I had to look over all the css files to find the element I wanted to change.<br><br>
	- Scheduling challenges<br>
	&emsp; Since we only had one class this week because of the 4 day weekend, and most communication was done through discord, there weren't any scheduling challenges that we faced. Also we used the one class we had as a work day, so we could have meaningful in person interactions. <br><br>

	&emsp; I faced several technical challenges this week. Specifically, I was trying to figure out how to create a collapsible navigation bar for small screens, but I wasn't able to find a solution despite my best efforts. However, I plan to continue studying and working on this task. At the very least, I'll have the separate html file for the navigation bar working. <br><br>
	- Scheduling challenges<br>
	&emsp; One personal scheduling challenge was about making out the time to work on this. My AP Stats class had quizzes every day this week, and I had AP Chem AP US History and AP Physics 1 test all in one day. I was overloaded with other classes work, and I had no personal time this week so it was really stressful. <br><br>

	&emsp; People started spamming useless draft issues to our github without description because of the new canvas assignment. Although it was a little annoying, our use of github issues were more active and useful and organized. <br><br>

	- Technical challenges<br>
	&emsp; One technical challenge we had was about email authentication. I had confusions about how the thing worked, but after listening to Mr. Ben's explanation during class, it made perfect sense. Another challenge I had was turning our navigation bar to a smaller collapsible menu when the screen gets smaller. I’m currently working on this, and will try to figure it out during the weekend if I have time.<br><br>
	- Scheduling challenges<br>
	&emsp; Our communication got a lot better after Mr. Ben talked about it, so our group could discuss a lot about our project. Also thanks to our project manager, everyone in our group got tasks through discord, and I liked it because people now have things to work on. However the task assignment seemed pretty random so I was a bit concerned about the outcomes. <br><br>
	- Interpersonal challenges<br>
	&emsp; One interpersonal challenge came in when assigning people tasks. Some people seemed to be unpleasant about getting tasks that weren't part of their role. This could be solved by more communication among our team members so we can figure out who works on what based on their preferences. <br><br>

      <h3>30-Jan-2023</h3>
      <p class="apa7">

	- Technical challenges<br>
	&emsp; We are still working on email authentication and rest apis. Other than that, the problem I had last week was solved by asking my teacher. He told me to just make the seat availability feature just for the primary schedule, and to not count the backup schedule. The solution was pretty simple; I don’t know why I couldn’t figure it out on my own.<br><br>
	- Scheduling challenges<br>
	&emsp; Since we had this week off because of bad weather, we couldn’t communicate much and had very little progress. But one of our teammates worked really hard during the off days, and he made great progress for the backend.<br><br>
	- Interpersonal challenges<br>
	&emsp; There weren’t any interpersonal challenges this week since we had so many days off, and because we had very little communication among our team. But I can say that the relationship of the two teammates who seemed to dislike each other improved.<br><br>

      <h3>23-Jan-2023</h3>
      <p class="apa7">

	- Technical challenges<br>
	&emsp; We still weren’t able figure out how we are going to make the login feature for seat availability without acquiring their student id or their school email. Also for last year, I remember that they wanted us to create several schedules as a backup in case we couldn’t schedule the class at the time we wanted. Because of this, I thought the seating availability feature would be unnecessary and confusing since the students will be creating multiple backup schedules. I would have to talk to my teammates and to my teacher to discuss about this.<br><br>
	- Scheduling challenges<br>
	&emsp; One scheduling challenge I had personally was about participating. From Tuesday through Friday, I had quizzes and tests every day which some of them were really content heavy. I also have upcoming tests on Monday and Tuesday, so I really didn’t have time to do anything related to this ISP this week. Also the class time was used up by the SQL lesson/quiz, so I didn’t have time even during class to work and communicate with our team members. There’s really nothing I can do about this issue, but I will work on my best to participate in this project whenever I’m not busy.<br><br>
	- Interpersonal challenges<br>
	&emsp; One interpersonal challenge was about communication. Many of our backend team members seemed lost including me. Someone in our group even asked for a task to do, but the answer that came back wasn’t clear. Also we have our chat channel in our discord server separate for front and back ends, but people just typed everything in one general channel so I had a hard time reading through all those unnecessary messages as a back end. We can solve this problem by using the todo list more actively and assigning people tasks to do.<br><br>

      <h3>16-Jan-2023</h3>
      <p class="apa7">

	- Technical challenges<br>
	&emsp; One technical challenge we had was about creating the feature that allows people to see how much seats are left. We were not allowed to take in any personal information like the student ID and school email, so we had to figure out a way to create some sort of a key that can be given to the user so that they can not take up more than one space in a class. We would have to communicate and come up with an idea to solve this issue.<br><br>
	- Scheduling challenges<br>
	&emsp; One scheduling challenge we had was about a meeting. We had a discord meeting on Thursday at 7 pm, but I could not join because I had other schedules going on. We could improve this issue by logging important discussions and decisions and letting people know that were not able to join.<br><br>
	- Interpersonal challenges<br>
	&emsp; There weren’t any interpersonal challenges this week, but some of our team members said that they were going to be splitting off of our project to create another scheduling app for next year. I hope that their project goes well.<br><br>

      <p class="apa7">

	- Technical challenges<br>
	&emsp; Technical challenges we had this week were about github. We were not able to lock the main branch and give access to only those who should. Because of this, many people pushed non-final stuff to the main branch instead of the working branch which made our team confused. We are trying to figure out a way to lock the main branch.<br><br>
	- Scheduling challenges<br>
	&emsp; We had a couple people who didn’t join the discord server for our ISP. Because of this, we had a delay in selecting the role and communicating for how things will plan out. However everyone eventually joined except for the one person who got grounded, so this issue is now solved. Another challenge was having a meeting with people who were not in our class period. We can overcome this issue by having some sort of a virtual meeting.<br><br>
	- Interpersonal challenges<br>
	&emsp; This week, we had minor conflicts with creating issues on github. We had to create 3 issues per person as a canvas assignment, but the problem was that we had like 20 people working on the same project. This made people to create meaningless/simple tasks as an issue and this enraged a couple people in our group. We solved this issue by closing most of the issues that didn’t have a description. <br><br>
