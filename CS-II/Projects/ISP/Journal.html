	- Technical challenges<br>
	&emsp; Technical challenges we had this week were about github. We were not able to lock the main branch and give access to only those who should. Because of this, many people pushed non-final stuff to the main branch instead of the working branch which made our team confused. We are trying to figure out a way to lock the main branch.<br><br>
	- Scheduling challenges<br>
	&emsp; We had a couple people who didn’t join the discord server for our ISP. Because of this, we had a delay in selecting the role and communicating for how things will plan out. However everyone eventually joined except for the one person who got grounded, so this issue is now solved. Another challenge was having a meeting with people who were not in our class period. We can overcome this issue by having some sort of a virtual meeting.<br><br>
	- Interpersonal challenges<br>
	&emsp; This week, we had minor conflicts with creating issues on github. We had to create 3 issues per person as a canvas assignment, but the problem was that we had like 20 people working on the same project. This made people to create meaningless/simple tasks as an issue and this enraged a couple people in our group. We solved this issue by closing most of the issues that didn’t have a description. <br><br>

      <p class="apa7">
	- (Software) Development Engineer<br>
	&emsp; Software Development Engineers are responsible for programming and designing the software. They would have to make sure that all features work as intended, and all the logic behind those features are valid and reasonable. This role could be challenging when creating a complex function that would have to handle many different cases. I would be suitable for this role because I have confidence in programming. <br><br>
	
	- QA Engineer<br>	
	&emsp; A QA Engineer ensures that the program functions properly without any errors and fixes bugs if any are found. Requires attention to all the details of the project and problem solving skills. This role could be challenging since they would have to try every possible way of breaking the logic of the code. I would be suitable for this role because I think I have the ability to think through most of the possible cases that could cause an error.<br><br>
	
	- Project Manager<br>
	&emsp; A project manager takes responsibility for leading the project. They will have to plan the project, set deadlines, and communicate with the team members to ensure that the project is on progress. This role could be challenging since they would be monitoring the whole project. I would not be suitable for this role because I am not good at taking care of multiple things at once. <br><br>
	
	- Product Manager<br>
	&emsp; A product manager is responsible for identifying the needs of the users and coming up with ideas and features to fulfill them. This role could be challenging because it requires knowledge of their target customers/users, and because they would have to communicate with them for possible feedback. It would be difficult to have this role in our project because the expectations of our project is already set by the school and there’s nothing much to do. <br><br>
	
	- Release Engineer<br>
	&emsp; A release Engineer manages, documents, and enhances the team's software products and implementation. They are responsible for software builds and releases. They work closely with QA Engineers to ensure that the program meets the standards. I would not be suitable for this role because I personally find it difficult to manage and document files. <br><br>
