      <p class="normal">
	When I used to have free time, I've always enjoyed playing instruments since I was young. When I was in second grade of elementary school in Korea, I learned my very first instrument which was the piano. The next instrument was the violin that I played for like 4 years for my own fun, and then the clarinet for a year for my school activity in Canada. After I moved to the United states, I self taught the acoustic guitar, and then the electric guitar. I also self taught the bass guitar and the drums when I joined the praise team for our church as an electric guitar, so I can play most of the band instruments at a proficient level.</p><br>
      <h1>Why is a Digital Portfolio beneficial to me</h1>
      <p class="normal">This Digital Portfolio is beneficial to me because it allows me to keep track of my accomplishments and progress in one place. It's also beneficial when it comes to applying for CS related fields because it provides information of myself and an idea of what kind of programmer I am.</p><br>
