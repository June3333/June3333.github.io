	&emsp; BYOD is a policy that allows students to bring their personal devices like laptops to school and use them for educational purposes. While this policy is growing concerns about cheating and final burden on families, I strongly believe that BYOD should be continued to be supported next year because school provided chromebooks are often slow and uncomfortable, and because many students are more familiar with Macs or Windows which are more compatible with certain programs that we use in school.
